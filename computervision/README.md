![Robert still](XX) 

Follow along with Robert in [his How To video](XX) by taking these steps:

To access the data and code, first download "[Object detection using Tiny YoloV2](https://support.sas.com/documentation/prod-p/vdmml/zip/tiny_yolov2_313cls.zip): 313 class object detection model and pre-trained weights" from this [Deep Learning Models and Tools web page](https://support.sas.com/documentation/prod-p/vdmml/zip/index.html). Then access a sampled version of the data, along with the adjusted program here: [Object Detection](./Object Detection.zip).
