These files support the concepts in [Ari Z.'s video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxL3lQgnuRE) for deploying open source models in SAS Viya.

* dmcas_fitstat.json – this is the JSON with the R fit statistics
* dmcas_fitstat_sas.json – this is the JSON template from SAS with fit statistics from a SAS model, this is the template we use, replacing the SAS fit stats with values from the R model
* dmcas_roc.json – this is the JSON with the R model ROC information
* dmcas_roc_sas.json – this is the JSON template from SAS with model ROC information from a SAS model, this is the template we use, replacing the SAS ROC information with values from the R model.
* R_Logistic_Regression_Code.R – this is the code used to build the R logistic regression model and output an XML file in PMML format, and to populate the JSON templates with the appropriate fit statistics.
* R_Logistic_Regression_Model.xml – this is the output XML file in PMML format generated by the code R_Logistic_Regression_Code.R.
